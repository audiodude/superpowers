# Superpowers for OpenCode

Complete guide for using Superpowers with [OpenCode.ai](https://opencode.ai).

## Installation

Add superpowers to the `plugin` array in your `opencode.json` (global or project-level):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["superpowers@git+https://github.com/audiodude/superpowers.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode. The plugin installs through OpenCode's plugin manager and
registers all skills.

Verify by asking the native `skill` tool to load `systematic-debugging`. Skills are advisory: use them when requested or clearly useful, and handle ordinary questions and simple edits directly.

OpenCode uses its own plugin install. If you also use Claude Code, Codex, or
another harness, install Superpowers separately for each one.

### Migrating from the old symlink-based install

Inspect the old Superpowers plugin and skills links under `~/.config/opencode/`. Remove only links or configuration entries that point to the old installation, then follow the installation steps above. Preserve unrelated plugins, personal skills, and any local modifications in the old clone. Start a fresh session to discard previously injected conversation instructions.

## Usage

### Finding Skills

Use OpenCode's native `skill` tool to list all available skills:

```
use skill tool to list skills
```

### Loading a Skill

```
use skill tool to load brainstorming
```

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.config/opencode/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

### Project Skills

Create project-specific skills in `.opencode/skills/` within your project.

**Skill Priority:** Project skills > Personal skills > Superpowers skills

## Updating

OpenCode installs Superpowers through a git-backed package spec. Some OpenCode
and Bun versions pin that resolved git dependency in a lockfile or cache, so a
restart may not pick up the newest Superpowers commit. If updates do not appear,
clear OpenCode's package cache or reinstall the plugin.

To pin a revision, replace `ADVISORY_COMMIT` with a commit from this fork. Inherited upstream tags retain the old behavior:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["superpowers@git+https://github.com/audiodude/superpowers.git#ADVISORY_COMMIT"]
}
```

## How It Works

The plugin registers the skills directory through the `config` hook, preserving existing paths and avoiding duplicates. It does not transform messages or load a bootstrap at startup. `using-superpowers` remains available as an optional entry guide.

### Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions rather than naming any one runtime's tools. On OpenCode these resolve to:

- "Create a todo" / "mark complete in todo list" → `todowrite`
- `Subagent (general-purpose):` template → OpenCode's `task` tool with `subagent_type: "general"` (or `"explore"` for codebase exploration)
- "Invoke a skill" → OpenCode's native `skill` tool
- "Read a file" → `read`
- "Create a file" / "edit a file" / "delete a file" → `apply_patch`
- "Run a shell command" → `bash`
- "Search file contents" / "find files by name" → `grep`, `glob`
- "Fetch a URL" → `webfetch`

(Verified against the installed OpenCode CLI's tool inventory.)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

1. Check OpenCode logs: `opencode run --print-logs "hello" 2>&1 | grep -i superpowers`
2. Verify the plugin line in your `opencode.json` is correct
3. Make sure you're running a recent version of OpenCode

### Windows install issues

Some Windows OpenCode builds have upstream installer issues with git-backed
plugin specs, including cache paths for `git+https` URLs and Bun not finding
`git.exe` even when it works in a normal terminal. If OpenCode cannot install
the plugin, try installing with system npm and pointing OpenCode at the local
package:

```powershell
npm install superpowers@git+https://github.com/audiodude/superpowers.git --prefix "$HOME\.config\opencode"
```

Then use the installed package path in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["~/.config/opencode/node_modules/superpowers"]
}
```

### Skills not found

1. Use OpenCode's `skill` tool to list available skills
2. Check that the plugin is loading (see above)
3. Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with valid YAML frontmatter

### Old startup policy still appearing

Remove any previous upstream plugin registration or bootstrap symlink before installing this fork, then start a fresh session. Existing conversation history can retain instructions injected by the previous installation.
